<p>I have a little Frog His name is tiny tim<br> I put him in the bathtub To see if he could swim He drank up all the water<br> And gobbled up the soap And when he tried to talk He had a bubble in his throat.</p>

    <p>Certain species of frogs can freeze nearly solid in the winter, and emerge unscathed in the spring</p>
    <p> Glass frogs make their skin transparent by hiding red blood cells in their livers.</p> 
    <p>Frogs use their eyeballs to help them eat.</p>
    <p>Frogs drink water through their skin.</p>
    <p>The world's largest frog species is known as the 'Goliath Frog'.</p>
    <p>Frogs eat mosquitoes; provide us with medical advances; serve as food for birds, fish and monkeys; and their tadpoles filter our drinking water. Plus frogs look and sound cool, and kids love them â€” so there are lots of reasons to save the frogs!</p>
